# 4-BandResistorCalculator
This is a python program that calculates Ohm values for 4-band resistors. I have not included tolerance into the calculation, so the user need only input the first three bands. This is super useful for anyone using 4-band resistors (and used by myself for Arduino projects)!

I have published this code under the MIT license, so use it as you'd like!

Enjoy.'
