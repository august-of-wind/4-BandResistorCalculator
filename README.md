# 4-BandResistorCalculator
This is a python program that calculates Ohm values for 4-band resistors. I have not included tolerance into the calculation, so the user need only input the first three bands. 

I wrote this program so I would not have to refer to Resistor Color Code charts any more, and thought others could find it useful as well.

Enjoy!
